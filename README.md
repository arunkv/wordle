# Wordle Solver

Solves the Wordle game interactively or optionally non-interactively.

_Wordle_ is a word puzzle in which the player has to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess,
the player is given feedback on the letters that are correct and in the correct position, correct but in the wrong
position, or incorrect.

## Statistics

### Letter Position Probability

This solver uses the probability of letters in each position to determine the best possible guess.

| Word List         | Words | Success Rate | Average Tries | Average Time Per Word (ms) |
|-------------------|-------|--------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Wordle (original) | 2315  | 99.0%        | 3.78          | 3                          |
| NYTimes Extended  | 14855 | 83.2%        | 4.57          | 21                         |

### Word Probability

This solver uses the probability of words in well known NLTK corpuses to determine the best possible guess.

| Word List         | Words | Success Rate | Average Tries | Average Time Per Word (ms) |
|-------------------|-------|--------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Wordle (original) | 2315  | 98.1%        | 4.19          | 4                          |
| NYTimes Extended  | 14855 | 83.2%        | 4.81          | 25                         |

### Entropy Lowering

This solver uses the entropy of the words to determine the best guess. The entropy score is calculated based on the
probability of resulting in greater number of exact or partial matches from a given guess. Computation of this
score is more time-consuming than the position probability solver.

| Word List         | Words | Success Rate | Average Tries | Average Time Per Word (ms) |
|-------------------|-------|--------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Wordle (original) | 2315  | 99.6%        | 3.57          | 14                         |
| NYTimes Extended  | 14855 | 90.5%        | 4.29          | 252                        |
