"""
This module provides functions to determine and process responses in the Wordle game.

Functions:
    get_response(is_non_interactive, word, guess, length): Determines the response based on the
    given word and guess.
    get_response_interactive(length): Prompts the user for a response and validates it.
    get_response_non_interactive(word, guess): Returns the response for a given word and guess.
    display_response(quiet, response): Displays the response to the user with colors.
    process_response(guess, response, search_space, known_letters, length): Processes the user's
    response to a guess.
